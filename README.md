# hello-world
This is my first hello-world.

I am new to coding and I have no idea what any of these terms mean, such as node.js and so on. But im willing to learn and im a fast learner.

I also have an amazing app idea that will change the way we shop secondhand. For example, Goodwill, or Platos closet. Its just in the idea stage, but by the end of this program, I plan to have a million dollar app that could even go worldwide. Yes, im that confident in my idea.
